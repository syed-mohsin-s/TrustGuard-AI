# TrustGuard-AI
here it's complete step-by-step process with supporting code, from data cleaning to model deployment, for building an AI-powered content moderation system. I'm planning to use Google tools like Gemini APIs, Vertex AI, and IDX. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

Step 1: Data Collection
First up is data collection. I want to include datasets related to hate speech, misinformation, and cyberbullying. I remember the Jigsaw Toxic Comments dataset is available on Kaggle, and FakeNewsNet is hosted on GitHub. I need to make sure these datasets are publicly and freely accessible. For data handling, I'll use pandas in Google Colab to load and clean the data. This will include removing duplicates and handling class imbalance, possibly using SMOTE from the imbalanced-learn library.

Step 2: Preprocessing
Since this is text data, I’ll need to handle tokenization. I’m considering using DistilBERT’s tokenizer from Hugging Face because it’s lightweight. But since I plan to use Gemini APIs, maybe I can integrate Gemini for tasks like fact-checking or sentiment analysis. I still need to look into how Gemini's API works for text analysis. Initial model training might require a custom model, though.

Step 3: Model Development
For model development, I’ll use Vertex AI. My plan is to upload the cleaned dataset to Google Cloud Storage and then either:

Use AutoML on Vertex AI for fast prototyping, or

Fine-tune a transformer model (e.g., using Hugging Face) and deploy it on Vertex AI.

I'll make sure to include code for both options — integrating Gemini APIs and training a custom model.

Step 4: Real-Time Deployment
For deployment, I’ll build a FastAPI backend and host it on Google Cloud Run. I’ll write a simple endpoint that accepts text input and returns moderation results. On top of that, I want to build a Streamlit dashboard for moderators. I’ll figure out how to connect the FastAPI backend to the frontend cleanly.

Step 5: Testing
I’ll write unit tests for the API using pytest, do performance testing with Locust, and evaluate ethical dimensions using tools like AI Fairness 360 and SHAP for explainability.

Step 6: Deployment
I'll use gcloud CLI commands to deploy services to Cloud Run. For data storage and feedback tracking, I plan to use Firestore. I'll also make sure my Python code properly initializes the Firestore client with the right credentials.

Step 7: Development Environment with IDX
Since the user wants to use Google IDX, I’ll develop the backend code inside that environment. Although the code snippets will be the same, I’ll explain how to set up IDX properly for this workflow.

Final Checklist
I’ll outline each phase with corresponding code snippets:

Data loading & cleaning in Colab

Model training with AutoML or Hugging Face + Vertex AI

FastAPI backend + Cloud Run deployment

Streamlit UI for moderators

Integration of Gemini APIs for tasks like sentiment or fact-checking

Testing (unit, performance, ethical)
